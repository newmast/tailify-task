Story:
As a world traveler I want to be able to find information about a given country.

Use case:
  - I need a list of all continents on the planet
  - When I select a continent I shall see all countries on that continent
  - When I select a country from the list I want to see some details about it

Objective:
Create a simple Apollo Server based graphql API implementing the following schema: https://gist.github.com/valeksiev/2649158722425cfdedf4e654685bd199

Resources:
Data source: https://github.com/annexare/Countries
Apollo Server: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/
Similar API: https://countries.trevorblades.com/

Requirements:
When a query is executed it must be logged into an external service for analytic purposes.
In the example logging some information about the query (timestamp, arguments, number of results) to the console is good enough.
Still this needs to be implemented in a good way because more services will be hooked to that in the future.

Notes:
- follow best practices and good coding standards; the AirBNB eslint config is a good start
- organize and structure your code as well as possible
- tests are not required but a huge plus
